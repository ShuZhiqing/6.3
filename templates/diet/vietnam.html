                    Average daily Vietnamese nutrition intake has high to very high amount of vitamin B12, B6, phosphorus, protein, and vitamin C.
                    This is due to the fact, people of Vietnamese background consume a lot of animal products, fruit, and vegetables mainly water spinach rich in vitamin C.
                    A moderate amount of sugar can still be tolerable, although it may be 5 grams more than recommended daily intake.
                    However, they need slightly more calcium to satisfy recommended daily intake.

                            In Vietnam, having 2 portions of pho daily and a bowl of water spinach is enough to maintain healthy teeth.
                            However, they are lack in calcium as there is only 7% of calcium in a serving of water spinach.
                            In Australia, milk is very easy to find and cheap.
                            This source of protein can be added into Vietnamese daily routine to complete the calcium needed for healthy teeth.
                            However, a substitute of tofu is also advisable, as tofu also contains high amount of calcium.
                            Surprisingly, Vietnamese eating habit does not include sugar that much as the people do not have a traditional afternoon tea or snack time like their British counterpart. Lower intake in sugar is very good to maintain healthy teeth.
